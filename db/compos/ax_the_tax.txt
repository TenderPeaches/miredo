I will ax the tax
You will ax the tax 
He will ax the tax 
let the tax be axed

land of the free 
    free to comply 
    free to bend the knee
land of the free for all 
    the greed for all 
    nationwide shopping mall
don't think you can fool us
    you shapiro-lite lookalike
    you will never be able to prove
    that you aren't twelve weasels in a human suit
you might rule but you'll never rule
    you insecure perfidious shit 
    you can kill us all 
    but you'll still feel that rope
you sorry fuck it won't take too much
    to punch a dagger through those chicken wings of yours
    which one of your kids itches the most, do you think
who's the psychopath 
    who's defunding abortion 
    defunding healthcare 
    sucking off the landlords 
    cradling the morons with lullabies
    like his bitch Smith and his boss Vlad
go fuck yourself, you diarrhea-filled bagpipes
    you are the abortion that must happen
go fuck yourself, you smell worse than a moshpit
go fuck yourself, the only people who can't tell you're an idiot
    are the dumbest fucking people in the world

from genocide to ecocide
    can't stop this train 
    it's running out of steam (we're running out of coal)
    through the shield through the plains
    through mountains and rain
