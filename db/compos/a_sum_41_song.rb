" 
it's late again I'm high as hell
can't solve it all and all is well
swear my heart's about to burst 
I'm so fucking stressed can't you tell
Ran out of cash running out of gas
Can't shake it off like my Legcay's ball joint
It's coming apart and it's just the start
Of the end of death of us under ten

****//""****$$%%*****""!!))$$////**$$/////

Two seconds to midnight
It's in the air 
Everywhere
Believe in hell
We've made it our home
