there...            and back again
a tale of collapse  by a street urchin
it's 20-something   it's all gone to shit
the market gulf stream food chain the atom core the ice caps
it's a ten-for-one special all you can't cease
discount gas burning wood another plague it's understood
the hobbits are fucked this ain't Hollywood

beyond...           the ends of the Shire
shadows...          of men and dark spires
oh how I wish...    I could still lay back
pipe in hand...     moist grass along my spine
singin' bout the end times while we still could
while we had strings to coil and trees to fell
brains to work and time to think oh we would sing
until the light of day about come what may
about shadows in the east long night in the deeps

but now I can't even hear
the fine violins in the wind
I can't taste the mead
that flowed by the kegful 
it's all soot and ash
snarling fiends to break the silence
my dear Frodo how'd it come to this

the elves are on fucking mars 
the dwarves are manufacturing cirrhosis
the hobbits wasting away on gachas
and the humans are still voting for the nazgul party
it's not the ring gandalf
    it's capitalism
    and it's everywhere
    and there's no mount doom
    because it's festering in all of us
    it's a cancer in the air
    it's the nickel in your lungs
    the lead in your blood
    the mercury in your skin
    it's every bit of micro-plastic
    stuck in between your nodes
    it's the trace amount of brake pads
    you've breathed in a million times
    it's the soot in your hair
    it's the dead look in your eyes


there and back again
    I hope you find this book
    because that means you exist
    and this book exists
    and thus something exists
    because you see, I, Bilbo Baggins
    am no more
    for as soon as I will put down this pen
    I will be found
    they will eat me
    and I can only pray
    that I will already be no more by then

here...             and back again
between this rock   that other rock
from one wall       to the next
foggy windows...    lidless room
from alcohol to meth
to naloxone and back again
might as well clap a cop in the eye
catch twenty five to life for a roof
and something vaguely resembling food
see you in the winter

'cause you see there's no one ring
there's about a thousand 
and thirty percent of these fuckheads
are voting for the nazguls
the halflings are drunk the dwarves are dead
the elves are on mars the ents in the air
and the rest of us are craving
for that sweet nuclear release
the long winter come
one mount doom to rule them all
one finger to pull the world
into the void it dared stretch open
