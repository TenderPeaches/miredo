too many men on the ice
too many men don't place nice
too many men in the box
too many men too many men

too many men in my hair
too many men everywhere
too many men just don't care
too many men too many men

too many men to feel safe
too many men not to look back
too many men on this side
too many men too many men

too many men on the ice
five is fine lets play nice
six is a whistle to the box
too many men too many men

too many men don't take a hint
too many men can't find the clit
too many men enabling men
too many men too many men
too many men too many men

too many men open their eyes
too many men lend an ear
too many men then go right back
to bread games taxes head in the sand
too many men too many men

too many men to ostracize
too many men to fantasize
too many men to cannibalize
too many men too many men

too many men in search of prey
too many men following the way
too many men too weak to pray
to a benevolent god that won't lead them astray
