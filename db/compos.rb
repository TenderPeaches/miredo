"Cold light reeks
So bright, so bleak
Irradiate 
    Examinate
Can't get away
	Fast enough, fast enough
Can't get away
	To darkness come
	
One day one way
Incognito(use cover?) keep low
Eyes restless 
    Feet quiet
Don't wake the beast
	It's time to sleep
Knives out knives out
	It's time to sleep
	
Blood spilled ill will
Done right good night
A badge 
    For the smelter
Red hat for the pyre
	Red hat for the pyre
Red hat for the pyre
	Red hat for the pyre"

Freedom's a joke
Bring on the woke
The people of the Railroad
The Son and his disciples
the queer the betrodden
the roots
	bloody roots
the roots
    bloody roots
the roots
    bloody roots
I'll take you to a place
Where we can find our roots
    bloody roots
Roots
    bloody roots
Rain, bring me the strength to see another day
    And all I want to see, set us free
    Why can't you see
    Can't you feel
    This is real"

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Carolina
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a-heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, hey momma rock me

Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel (I wanna feel)
Hey, hey momma rock me (momma rock me, momma rock me)
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
(I wanna rock like a south bound train)
Hey momma rock me
Rock me
