## Progression Template naming
Keep progression template tags as generic as possible. Most progression templates will have one of the following tags:
    Intro, Verse, Chorus, Pre-Chorus, Post-Chorus, Bridge, Riff 1/2/3/..., Solo, Break, Ending, Outro
Sometimes, different progression templates are used for the same song structure element. In such cases, use letters to differentiate the templates, for instance:
    Verse A, Verse B
Sometimes, especially with repeating patterns, it becomes easier to split up a song structure element into smaller progression templates. When this happens, use a "pt 1/2/3..." (part 1, 2, 3) suffix, like so:
    Bridge pt1, Bridge pt2
Sometimes, songs are split into multiple sub-parts, each with their own song structure elements, like distinct verses and choruses. In these rare cases, use square bracket around a number indicating the sub-song's position within the song. For instance:
    [1] Verse, [1] Chorus, [2] Verse, etc.

## Progression naming
Progressions are named after the song structure element which they represent. Use numbers to differentiate similar song structure elements, like:
    Verse 1, Chorus 1, Verse 2, etc.
Often, a song structure element will be represented by a single progression. However, there might be a song structure element that spans multiple progressions. In such cases, use the same tag for all progressions that represent the given song structure element. This will tell the interprester that all these progressions should be thought of as a single block, like the song's bridge, for example.
