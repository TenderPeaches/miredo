    # to translate to and from easily legible progression chord cyphers
    # for instance, rather than defining a progresison chord as "1st degree+1 minor chord with bass note of 5th degree+1 for 4 beats", the user could instead simply input a plain string "C#m/G#----" and leave it to the program to translate that into a ProgressionChord
