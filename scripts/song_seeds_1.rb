Is there freedom without fear?; Unravel and untangle all you thought you understood, And question everything until you question why you should; We'll change the world with flowers, or we'll change the world with guns, We'll plant a seed or dig a grave before it's said and done; But if we come together all for one and one for all, Resistance rises up sure as an empire will fall; 3> So I'll just work toward the future may it crumble for the better, Where tyrannical oppressors are but shadows we remember; No judgment based on color or your lover or your gender, Dismantle older models so they can't be reassembled; But the day the tables turn your way, watch out for a twist of fate, Careful not to stumble and become the very thing you hate; Seek out something comforting, search for something innocent, But you'll never have those eyes that look at life that way again; So you can take the high road, nothing ventured, nothing gained, But you'll fight fire with fire when you're going down in flames I'm sayin'; 4> Stop the world, I wanna get off, Cause we're at each other's throats and now it's choking my heart; And we can burn the earth or extinguish the torch, When the fury of the frayed wind blows; 7> 5>;")

If you want something better, you gotta put that shit aside.\"; 3> I thought about how for thousands of years there have been people who told us that things can't go on like this; From Jesus Christ to the Diggers, from Malthus to Zerzan, from Karl Marx to Huey Newton; 3> But the shit goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on; 4> Now, I'm not saying that we can't change the world, 'cause everybody does at least a little bit of that; But I won't shit myself, the way I'm living is a temper tantrum and I need something else, need something else, need something else to stay alive; 5> 6> And on the night that I play my last show, I'll be screaming so loud that my heart explodes; And I'll be singing, I'll be singing: 'We are free!'; Oh, but won't you promise me that we won't ever forget what the means?; I know it's hard to give a shit sometimes, but promise me we'll always try; 3> Cause I don't wanna hate you, and I don't wanna hate me, and I don't wanna have to hate everything anymore; 2> 7> ;")
