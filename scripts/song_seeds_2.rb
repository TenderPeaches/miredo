Well I can't seem to recall your face; Mom says that you've gone to go die alone, while I suffer in this hell ridden place; Are you selfish because you're not listening? Are you blind 'cause you don't understand oh no?; Dear Father it's me who's asking for your sympathy for I have no more room left to stand; Well I sat in that driveway for hours, For months, and for days, and for years with no end; And I sat by the phone, sent letters to the unknown, In hopes that I'd see you again; Dear Father, why can't I see you? Your name's not existent on this tongue anymore; Your face is just a shade, while your voice it still plays, on that record box that says forever yours; Dear daughter, dear daughter, I hear you, Though this voice is a fragment of your younger days; when the sky was still bright, and everything still seemed right, Till they took that damn sunshine away; I cry every time that I see you, In the pictures I have from oh so long ago; Well I tried hard to fight, So everyday I'd say goodnight, And good morning, I love you, don't let go; Well your father did try hard to be there, his love still exists in everyday that you age; But your father's a deadbeat, a bum, and a drunk, and there's no room for that on life's stage; Dear daughter I wish that I could see you, But I want to go straighten my shitty life out just for yours; Went to school and got a job, to learn how to stop being a slob, Do you have that record box that says forever yours?; Oh the day, oh the days keep on passing, Well I have no Idea what a god damn father is; I can't remember mine, but I guess that it's still fine, Because it seems to me like he hates his kid; Well I said that I would wait forever, But that was for some other man; One who swore that he cared, and he sang he'd be there, but he isn't so I've finally washed my hands; No more waiting, nor hoping, or dreaming, No more clinging to your stupid, frivolous things; I've thrown them away to grow up and go play, in the trash is where your record box sings; Well dear father, I cannot see you, But it's not in my interest to care anymore; I hate you I swear, I'm alone and I'm scared, So I saved that record box that says forever yours; My honey, my Valkyrie, my daughter, Your mother has finally called; Our contacts were lost, and so for hours we fought, But that pain has finally been resolved; It's finally so good to hear you, You've grown quite a bit into a beautiful girl; Your mom sent me a photo and I can't help but cry, Because darlin' you're my whole entire world; Well I have so many stories to tell you, so many pictures, and books, and songs to be heard; I have millions for you that I saved up, yes it's true, And I'll make it home I swear you have my word; Dear daughter, I'm sorry to tell you, For you be seeing me anymore; For my car did a flip, while I was going 96, So my body has covered the floor; Well I hope that you never forget me, And never forget that you were loved and that's for sure; I know you'll get my things, and I know you'll hear me sing on that record box that says forever; Record box that says forever, record box that says forever yours;")
